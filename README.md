This is our ([Mohamad Amin Mohamadi](https://github.com/mohamad-amin) and [Sina Malakouti](https://github.com/sinamalakouti) and [Amirhosein Beheshti](https://github.com/A-H-B-Gh)).
In this project we developed a game similar to famous game Age of Empires in 2D environment.
Main Features of this project are :

1) Users can chose to play with computer ( with simple AI) or other players.</br>
2) we used search algorithms such as Dijkstra to simulate movement mechanism of the entities such as soldiers based on the obstacles in the map that could be designed using our map editor.</br>
3) Users can both save and load game and map.</br>




### Menu :

In menu there are options like : playing with computers , multiplayers, making map, and loading the game.
